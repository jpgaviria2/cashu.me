## üéØ What You Need to Do (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Fresh PowerShell

Close your current PowerShell and open a new one. This picks up Node.js in PATH.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```powershell
cd C:\Users\JuanPabloGaviria\git\cashu.me
npm install
```

**If you get permission errors:**
```powershell
# Close any editors/terminals that have files open
# Then try:
npm install --force

# Or:
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start Dev Server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
 App ‚Ä¢ Opening default browser at https://localhost:8080/
 App ‚Ä¢ Ready! HTTPS is enabled...
```

Your browser will automatically open!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: npm install fails with EPERM

**Solution 1:** Close all editors/terminals
```powershell
# Close VS Code, terminals, etc.
# Then:
npm install --force
```

**Solution 2:** Delete node_modules
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

**Solution 3:** Run as Administrator
```powershell
# Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí Run as Administrator
cd C:\Users\JuanPabloGaviria\git\cashu.me
npm install
```

### Issue: npm not found

**Solution:** Restart PowerShell
```powershell
# Close and reopen PowerShell
# Node.js was just installed, needs fresh session
```

### Issue: Port 8080 in use

**Solution:** Kill the process
```powershell
# Find process
netstat -ano | Select-String ":8080"

# Kill it (replace PID)
Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force

# Or use different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Issue: Onboarding doesn't show

**Solution:** Clear localStorage
```javascript
// In browser console (F12)
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

## üìä What's Working vs What Needs Backend

### ‚úÖ Works Now (Frontend Only)

- Onboarding flow (all 4 steps)
- Identity generation (npub from seed)
- Lightning address display
- QR code generation
- Copy to clipboard
- Mint integration (ecash.trailscoffee.com)
- Token send/receive (via mint)
- Transaction history
- Settings page with seed backup

### ‚è≥ Needs Backend (Phase 2)

- Lightning address registration (npubcash-server)
- Actual LNURL-pay receiving
- Token custody for offline users
- Auto-claim pending payments
- NIP-05 verification

**Note:** The identity system works perfectly without the backend. It just won't register the Lightning address externally until npubcash-server is deployed.

- [ ] Browser opens to https://localhost:8080

- [ ] Progress indicators work
- [ ] Lightning address is generated
- [ ] Can copy address
- [ ] QR code dialog opens
