# Test Token Helper for Bluetooth Testing

## Problem

You can't test Bluetooth token transfers without having tokens first!

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Use Testnut Mint (No Setup Required)

1. Open https://testnut.cashu.space in a browser
2. Click "Mint" â†’ Generate 100 sats (free testnet)
3. Copy the token
4. Paste into your app's "Receive" tab
5. Now you have tokens to send via Bluetooth!

### Option 2: Use wallet.cashu.me

1. Go to https://wallet.cashu.me
2. Add Testnut mint: `https://testnut.cashu.space`
3. Request test tokens (free)
4. Copy token
5. Paste in your app

### Option 3: Use Another Device

If you have the app on Device 2:
1. Get tokens on Device 2 first (using above methods)
2. Then send from Device 2 â†’ Device 1 via Bluetooth
3. Now Device 1 has tokens to send back!

## Current Testing Workflow

```
Step 1: Get Tokens
â”œâ”€ Use testnet mint (testnut.cashu.space)
â”œâ”€ Request 100 test sats (free)
â””â”€ Receive in wallet

Step 2: Verify Balance
â”œâ”€ Check wallet shows balance > 0
â””â”€ Wallet now has keysets

Step 3: Test Bluetooth
â”œâ”€ Device 1: Has tokens (sender)
â”œâ”€ Device 2: Empty (receiver)
â”œâ”€ Send 10 sats via "Send to Nearby"
â””â”€ Device 2 receives notification

Step 4: Test Round-Trip
â”œâ”€ Device 2 now has 10 sats
â”œâ”€ Send 5 sats back to Device 1
â””â”€ Verify mesh networking works both ways
```

## For Production Testing

If you're testing with real Trails Coffee tokens:

1. **Admin generates tokens:**
   ```
   # In Trails Coffee admin panel
   - Create token: 100 sats
   - Copy token string
   ```

2. **Receive on device:**
   - Open app â†’ Receive tab
   - Paste token
   - Confirm receipt

3. **Now test Bluetooth:**
   - Has balance âœ“
   - Has keysets âœ“
   - Can send via Bluetooth âœ“

## Quick Commands

### Check if wallet has tokens
```bash
adb logcat -d | grep -i "balance\|sats\|amount" | grep Capacitor/Console | tail -5
```

### Monitor token receive
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "receive.*token|claimed|keyset.*found"
```

### Check Bluetooth status
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "BluetoothMesh|peer ID|nearby"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No keysets found" Error
**Cause:** Wallet is empty
**Fix:** Receive tokens first (see options above)

### "Cannot connect to mint"
**Cause:** Network issue or mint down
**Fix:** Try testnut.cashu.space (reliable testnet)

### "Token already claimed"
**Cause:** Token was used before
**Fix:** Generate new token

## Recommended Test Flow

For testing Bluetooth WITHOUT needing real money:

1. **Both devices install app** âœ“
2. **Device 1: Get testnet tokens**
   - Use testnut.cashu.space
   - Mint 100 sats (free)
   - Paste in app

3. **Device 1 â†’ Device 2: Send 50 sats via Bluetooth**
   - Tests mesh networking
   - Tests token creation
   - Tests peer discovery

4. **Device 2 â†’ Device 1: Send 25 sats back**
   - Tests bidirectional
   - Tests mesh relay
   - Verifies end-to-end
